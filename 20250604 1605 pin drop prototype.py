    **How real demographic data would be obtained:**
    1.  **Spatial Lookup:** Use the clicked latitude/longitude to find the specific Statistical Area 1 (SA1) or Meshblock boundary it falls within. This requires a geographic dataset of NZ boundaries.
    2.  **Stats NZ API Query:** Once the SA1/Meshblock ID is known, an API call to Statistics New Zealand's Aotearoa Data Explorer API would be made to retrieve relevant demographic indicators (e.g., population counts, age distribution, ethnicity, income, household composition) for that specific area.
    3.  **Data Processing:** The API response (typically JSON) would be parsed and presented.
